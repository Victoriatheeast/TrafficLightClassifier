# TrafficLightClassifier

This project builds a classifier for images of traffic lights in the Jupyter notebook. The classifier pre-processes the images from the dataset, extracts features that help distinguish the different types of images, and uses those features to classify the traffic light images into three classes: red, yellow, or green.
